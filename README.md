ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Greg

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in many different tech related things. 
I work full time as an iOS Dev, but my skills and experience very significally. 

Im passionate about creating apps, entrepreneurship, photography and videography, and more recently nocode and blockchain.



### Things im currentyly working on

Im developing a flutter application to help creatives meet other creatives for collaborations. 

This application is going to be available in android and iOS, and has a firebase backend, and a separate stripe server to handle payments.

Some of the features include:
- Push notifications
- Direct messages
- User profiles
- Payments
- Comprehensive onbaording flow, phone Auth, instagram Auth and a manual admin verification.


### Content creator

As a way to document my story I've started a youtube channel. My plan with this channel is to talk about the things that I am working on, and 
create videos on building different products or applications using nocode.
